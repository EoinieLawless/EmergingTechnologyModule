    "### Classical Computing \n",
    "A classical computer, Like the one you are using right now, we use bits (short for \"binary digit\") as the basic unit of information. These are the smallest unit of data in computing, We represent these bits by either a 0 or a 1 (These are also called states). These are used for the operations performed to do complex calculations and programs by manipulating sequences of bits (often by being turned into Bytes, 8 Bits in a sequence to create a character). It's the foundation of most of the computing technology we use daily.<a href=\"https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems#quantum-information\">[1]<a></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Computing\n",
    "Quantum computers share many of the same qualities of classical computers, circuits, logic gates..etc. However they use quantum bits (Quibits for short), These can represent 0, 1, or any combination of both simultaneously due to a property called \"superposition\".  This superposition basically means it can be in between the 0 and 1 until its actually measured. \n",
    "So what can this Quibit be used for in terms of quantum computing? Quibits play an essential role to simulate molecular-level quantum mechanics, such as Quantum entanglement. This is multiple states of quibits together, which means they are linked (entangled) together, giving access to unknown corners of classical computing. <a href=\"https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems#quantum-information\">[1]<a><a href=\"https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-computing-computers\">[3]<a></a>\n",

In more modern day computing, these bits are shown by the the lack or presence of an electrical signal, giving the 0 or 1. \n",
