### Eoin Lawless
## Deutsch's Algorithm

# Project Notebook
The point of this Journal is to:

- Explore Deutsch-jozha algorithm 
- how to solve the problem 
- build quantum circuits using Qiskit to implement the algorithm, inlcude oracle circuits to demonstrate 

In this Journal I talk about the beginnings of classical computing and how it makes it's way into Quantum computing 

I delve into the information of Bits, Quibits, Deutsch-jozha algorithm and Circuit design

- Task 1 - The Collatz Conjecture
- Task 2 - Square Root Python
- Task 3 - Random Bit Functions
- Task 4 - Matrix Multiplication
